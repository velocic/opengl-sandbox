# opengl-sandbox
A container project for my adventures into learning OpenGL

Within this repository you will find a collection of quick-and-hacky implementations of various tutorials
that I've been following from various places as I work to teach myself graphics programming. The code is pretty messy,
as I'm basically just rapid-developing OpenGL samples to learn graphics programming concepts from, but I don't intend
to use much of this code anywhere else.

One thing that may be of use to others are my Shader.h/cpp and ProgramLinker.h/cpp files. I spent a good amount of time
trying to make those into pretty well-structured file loaders & GLSL compilers. These files exist in the "Common" directory
at the root of the project.
